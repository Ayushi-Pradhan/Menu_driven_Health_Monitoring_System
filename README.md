# Menu_driven_Health_Monitoring_System

Health is a major concern for everyone.
Clinical decisions are made based on doctorâ€™s experience and intuition which can sometimes lead to marginal errors.
These errors can cause serious health issues.
To overcome these errors, we have chosen this project.
We have taken into account 4 very common diseases that are:
Heart Disease,
Diabetes,
Mental Health Issues and
Breast Cancer (in women).

Our main objective is to  predict the possibility of suffering from the aforementioned diseases.
To achieve this we have developed various machine learning and deep neural network models.
A comparative analysis has been done among the following Machine learning models/algorithms:
Support Vector Classifier Algorithm (SVC),
Random Forest Classifier,
AdaBoost Classifier,
Gradient Boost Classifier and
Logistic Regression.
Not only ML algorithms we have also implemented deep learning model using Neural Network with Keras Classifier which is a very popular python library widely used for deep learning.

Also for obtaining the most optimised results we have applied hyper-parameter tuning techniques such as:
Random search,
Grid search and
Bayesian optimisation.
Additionally, we have designed a dynamic website in which users can input their preliminary test data and the integrated model will predict the possibility of suffering from the disease in real-time.
The website has a menu driven and user-friendly monitoring system.
Anybody with the required test data can easily predict their health status through the website.

Additionally we have performed Wilcoxon signed rank test to verify the model we are selecting is indeed the best one for actual prediction of results in website.
